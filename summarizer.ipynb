Whether you're a seasoned Python developer or just getting started, it's essential to review and reinforce your knowledge of Python's fundamental concepts. In this Python refresher, we'll revisit some of these key concepts to help you strengthen your Python programming skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Variables and Data Types#\n",
      "\n",
      "Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to explicitly declare variable types. Here are some of the most common data types in Python, along with code examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "Boolean Values (bool)#\n",
      "\n",
      "Boolean values represent true or false. They are often used in conditional statements and logical operations. Examples include True and False.\n",

      "Dictionaries (dict)#\n",
      "\n",
      "Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a value, and they are defined using curly braces {}. Examples include {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}, {\"city\": \"New York\", \"population\": 8.4 million}, and {} (an empty dictionary).\n",

      "Control Structures#\n",
      "\n",
      "Python offers control structures for decision-making and repetition. These control structures allow you to manage the flow of your program and perform actions based on conditions or repeatedly execute code. Let's explore some of the key control structures in Python:\n",
      "\n",
      "If Statements#\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditional statements, often referred to as \"if statements,\" are used to make decisions in your code. They allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "if age >= 18:\n",
      "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, if the age is greater than or equal to 18, it prints \"You are an adult\"; otherwise, it prints \"You are a minor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While Loops#\n",
      "\n",
      "The while loop is used for repetitive tasks. It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition is true. Be cautious to avoid infinite loops by ensuring that the condition eventually becomes false.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "# This code snippet prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.\n",
      "i = 1\n",

      "    i += 1\n",
      "\n",
      "For Loops (for-in)#\n",
      "\n",
      "The for loop, often used with the in keyword, is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list or string). It simplifies iteration and is commonly used in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "# Iterate through the fruits list and prints each fruit.\n",
      "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",

      "Break and Continue Statements#\n",
      "\n",
      "Python provides two special statements within loops: break and continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. It terminates the loop's execution based on a condition.\n",
      "The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next one.\n",
      "\n",
      "These statements are handy for controlling loop behavior and responding to specific conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "# Exit the loop when i is equal to 5, preventing further iterations.\n",
      "for i in range(1, 11):\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we define a class called Person with attributes name and age. The __init__ method is a special method called when an object is created, and the greet method returns a personalized greeting for the person.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then create an instance of the Person class named alice with the name \"Prajwal\" and age 25. Finally, we call the greet method for the alice object to print a greeting message.\n",

      "from geometry_project.utils import math_operations\n",
      "\n",
      "Exceptions#\n",
      "\n",
      "Exceptions are events that occur during program execution when something unexpected or erroneous happens. These exceptions can disrupt the normal flow of your code, and handling them appropriately is essential to ensure your program remains robust and responsive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Try-Except Block#\n",
      "\n",
      "The try-except block is used to catch and handle exceptions in Python. Here's the basic structure:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "try:\n",
      "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
      "except ExceptionName:\n",
      "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down how the try-except block works:\n",
      "\n",
      "The try block contains the code that you suspect might raise an exception.\n",
      "If an exception occurs within the try block, Python immediately jumps to the corresponding except block.\n",
      "In the except block, you specify the type of exception you want to catch (e.g., ExceptionName). This is optional, and you can use a generic except clause to catch any exception.\n",
      "Within the except block, you can write code to handle the exception, which might include logging an error message, recovering from the error, or taking other appropriate actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider an example where we attempt to divide a number by zero, which would raise a ZeroDivisionError exception:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "try:\n",
      "    result = 10 / 0  # Attempting to divide by zero\n",
      "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
      "    print(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the try block attempts to perform a division operation that can result in a ZeroDivisionError. When the exception occurs, Python immediately transfers control to the except block, where we print an error message.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "# Handling multiple exceptions\n",
      "try:\n",
      "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
      "except ExceptionType1:\n",
      "    # Code to handle ExceptionType1\n",
      "except ExceptionType2:\n",
      "    # Code to handle ExceptionType2\n",
      "\n",
      "File I/O#\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, you can read from and write to files using the open() function. This functionality is crucial for handling data persistence and interacting with external files.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading a File#\n",
      "\n",
      "To read the contents of a file, you can use the open() function with the mode \"r\" (read mode). Here's how you can read a file:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
      "    content = f.read()\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing to a File#\n",
      "\n",
      "To write data to a file, you can use the open() function with the mode \"w\" (write mode). Here's how you can write to a file:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "# Writing to a file\n",
      "with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n",
      "    f.write(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional File Modes#\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to \"r\" (read) and \"w\" (write) modes, there are other modes you can use with the open() function, such as \"a\" (append) for appending data to a file without truncating it and \"b\" for binary mode when dealing with non-text files.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lambda Functions#\n",
      "\n",
      "Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a concise way to define small, one-time-use functions in Python. They are defined in a single line using the lambda keyword.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "lambda arguments: expression\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how you can define and use a lambda function:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "# Defining a lambda function\n",
      "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
      "\n",
      "# Using a lambda function\n",
      "result = add(2, 3)\n",
      "print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example:\n",
      "\n",
      "We define a lambda function called add that takes two arguments x and y and returns their sum.\n",
      "We then use the lambda function by calling add(2, 3), which returns 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lambda functions are commonly used in functional programming and with functions like map(), filter(), and sorted().\n",
      "\n",
      "Generators#\n",
      "\n",
      "Generators in Python are a powerful way to create iterable sequences of items. Unlike lists or other data structures, generators create values on-the-fly as you iterate over them. This can be incredibly efficient, especially for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defining a Generator#\n",
      "\n",
      "Generators are defined using functions, just like regular functions, but instead of using the return keyword, they use the yield keyword. The yield statement is used to produce a value from the generator function while preserving the function's state for the next iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of a simple generator function:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "# Defining a generator\n",
      "def countdown(n):\n",
      "    while n > 0:\n",
      "        yield n\n",
      "        n -= 1\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the countdown generator yields a sequence of numbers from n down to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a Generator#\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've defined a generator, you can use it to iterate over the generated values. You typically create a generator object by calling the generator function with the desired parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "# Using a generator\n",
      "countdown_generator = countdown(5)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can retrieve values from the generator using the next() function, as shown here:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "print(next(countdown_generator))  # Output: 5\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also iterate over the generator using a for loop, which will continue until the generator is exhausted:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "for i in countdown_generator:\n",
      "    print(i)  # Output: 4, 3, 2, 1\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Generators are memory-efficient and are especially useful when dealing with large datasets or when you want to create sequences dynamically. They allow you to work with data one item at a time, rather than loading everything into memory at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decorators#\n",
      "\n",
      "Decorators in Python are a powerful way to modify the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code. They are often used to add functionality or behavior to functions dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defining a Decorator#\n",
      "\n",
      "A decorator is itself a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that usually extends or enhances the behavior of the original function. Decorators are typically defined using the @ symbol followed by the decorator function's name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of defining a simple decorator called uppercase:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "# Defining a decorator\n",
      "def uppercase(func):\n",
      "    def wrapper():\n",
      "        result = func()\n",
      "        return result.upper()\n",
      "    return wrapper\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the uppercase decorator takes a function func as an argument, and it defines an inner function wrapper that modifies the result of func by converting it to uppercase.\n",
      "\n",
